ESC403 Introduction to Data Science Project

---

## Description

In this project, we analyse a Kaggle dataset containing 27000+ tweets that have been labelled with a sentiment (negative, neutral, or positive), and also explore various methods in sentiment analysis.

## Motivation

Through this project we hope to gain experience with Natural Language Processing and GitHub, as well as practise what we have learned in the course.


## Results

|             Method              | Accuracy |
| :------------------------------ | :------: |
| Random forest (bootstrap=False) | 0.7005   |
| DistilBERT (3 epochs)           | 0.7845   |
| DistilBERT (2 epochs)           | 0.7890   |
| BERT                            | 0.7903   |
| Tom                             | 0.6415   |
| Jessica                         |          |



Tasks:

Tom - Finish BERT (possibly add another model, if time left), write a short script to test human-level accuracy - DONE

Plot all methods in one graphs, create the slides (possibly discuss over Skype first) - maybe one slide could be some pros/cons table of all models.
